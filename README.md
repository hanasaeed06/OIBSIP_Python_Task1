# OIBSIP_VoiceAssistant_Task1

## ðŸš€ Project Title
Simple Voice Assistant

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a basic voice assistant application that responds to voice commands like greetings, tells time/date, fetches Wikipedia summaries, tells jokes, plays YouTube videos, and interacts with the user via a graphical interface.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text)
- pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
- Wikipedia API
- pyjokes (for jokes)
- Webbrowser (to open YouTube)
- datetime module

## ðŸ“‹ Features Implemented
- Responds to greetings like "hello" or "hi"
- Provides current time, date, and day of the week
- Fetches Wikipedia summaries for queries starting with "who is" or "what is"
- Tells jokes
- Plays requested songs on YouTube
- Gracefully exits on commands like "bye", "stop", or "exit"
- GUI with a button to activate voice commands and a text box to display conversation

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use
1. Run the Python script `voice_assistant.py`.
2. Click the **Speak** button.
3. Speak your command clearly into the microphone.
4. The assistant will respond both via voice and the GUI output area.

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions
1. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia pyjokes
    ```
2. Make sure your microphone is enabled and working.

## âœ… Outcome
The voice assistant successfully responds to basic voice commands, providing useful information and entertainment, all through a simple user interface.

## ðŸ§  Learning Experience
This project helped me understand speech recognition, text-to-speech, integrating APIs, and building user-friendly desktop applications with Python.
